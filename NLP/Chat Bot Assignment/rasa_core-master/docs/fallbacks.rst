:desc: Fallback and Default Actions in Rasa Core

.. _fallbacks:

Fallback Actions
==========================



Sometimes you want to fall back to a fallback action like saying "Sorry, I didn't understand that".
To do this, add the ``FallbackPolicy`` to your policy ensemble.
The fallback action will be executed if the intent recognition has a confidence below ``nlu_threshold``
or if none of the dialogue policies predict an action with confidence higher than ``core_threshold``

.. code-block:: python

   from rasa_core.policies.fallback import FallbackPolicy
   from rasa_core.policies.keras_policy import KerasPolicy
   from rasa_core.agent import Agent

   fallback = FallbackPolicy(fallback_action_name="action_default_fallback",
                             core_threshold=0.3,
                             nlu_threshold=0.3)

   agent = Agent("domain.yml",
                  policies=[KerasPolicy(), fallback])


``action_fallback`` is a default action in Rasa Core, which will send the
``utter_default`` template message to the user. Make sure to specify this template
in your domain file. It will also revert back to the state of the conversation
before the user message that caused the fallback, so that it will not influence
the prediction of future actions. You can take a look at the source of the
action below:

.. autoclass:: rasa_core.actions.action.ActionDefaultFallback

.. note::
  You can also create your own custom action to use as a fallback. Be aware
  that if this action does not return a ``UserUtteranceReverted`` event, the
  next predictions of your bot may become inaccurate, as it very likely that the
  fallback action is not present in your stories

If you have a specific intent that will trigger this, let's say it's called ``out_of_scope``, then you
should add this as a story:

.. code-block:: md

    ## fallback story
    * out_of_scope
      - action_default_fallback
