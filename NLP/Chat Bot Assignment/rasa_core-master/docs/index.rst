   :text: Rasa is a framework for building conversational software:
      Messenger/Slack bots, Alexa skills, etc. We'll abbreviate this as a <strong>bot</strong>
      in this documentation.

   :text: What's cool about it?
   :sender: user

.. chat-bubble::
   :text: Rather than a bunch of <code>if/else</code> statements, the logic of your bot is
      based on a probabilistic model trained on example conversations.
   :sender: bot

.. chat-bubble::
   :text: That sounds harder than writing a few <code>if</code> statements.

.. chat-bubble::
   :text: In the beginning of a project, it seems easier to just hard code some logic.
      Rasa helps you when you want to go past that and create a bot that can handle more complexity.
      This <a href="https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a" target="_blank">blog post </a> explains the philosophy behind Rasa Core.
