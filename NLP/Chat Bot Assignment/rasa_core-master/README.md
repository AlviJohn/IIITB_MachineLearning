## Introduction

Rasa Core is a framework for building conversational software, which includes:
- chatbots on Messenger
- Slack bots
- Alexa Skills
- Google Home Actions

etc. 

Rasa Core's primary purpose is to help you build contextual, layered conversations with lots of back-and-forth.
To have a real conversation, you need to have some memory and build on things that were said earlier.
Rasa Core lets you do that in a scalable way. 

There's a lot more background information in this [blog post](https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a)

## Where to get help

There is extensive documentation:

- [master](https://core.rasa.com/master/)&nbsp; (if you install from **github**) or 
- [stable](https://core.rasa.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you install from **pypi**)


Please use [Rasa Community Forum](https://forum.rasa.com) for quick answers to

In general the process is rather simple:
1. create an issue describing the feature you want to work on (or have a look at issues with the label [help wanted](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22))
2. write your code, tests and documentation
3. create a pull request describing your changes

You pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who might get back to you about any necessary changes or questions. You will also be asked to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/RasaHQ/rasa_core)


## Development Internals
